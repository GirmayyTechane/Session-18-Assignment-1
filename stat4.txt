#Session 18: Assignment 1
Problem Statement 1:
Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

           High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total
    Female    60            54      46     41    201
    Male      40            44      53     57    194
    Total    100            98      99     98    395

Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In
other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender
of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?

#Solution

Given: Below is given Observerd value table
           High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total
    Female    60            54      46     41    201
    Male      40            44      53     57    194
    Total    100            98      99     98    395
    
We know that 
Ho:Null Hypothesis: The two categorical variables are independent
Ha:Alternative Hypothesis: The two categorical variables are dependent
Step1:We shall find Ho Value but first lets find expected value E  under the null hypothesis using formula 
E=(row total×column total)/sample size

Below is Expected value(E) table
            High School  Bachelors   Masters   Ph.d.   Total
    Female    50.886	      49.868	 50.377	  49.868	  201
    Male      49.114	      48.132	 48.623	  48.132	  194
    Total     100	          98	     99	      98	      395
    
 Step2: lets find test statistics  Using   Chi-Square Test Statistic using formula:χ2=∑(O−E)2/E
 χ2=(60−50.886)2/50.886+⋯+(57−48.132)2/48.132=8.006


The critical value of χ2 with 3 degree of freedom is 7.815. 
Answer: we reject the null hypothesis as 8.006 > 7.815.
Conclusion: the education level depends on gender at a 5% level of significance.
